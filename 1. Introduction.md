## Introduction to Avidica

Avidica is characterized by its innovative approach to decentralized governance, focusing on collaboration and collective decision-making. Central to this framework are the Universal Business Groups (UBGs), which play a crucial role in Avidica's governance structure. UBGs are not only integral to decision-making but also embody the philosophy of Avidica, which merges individual autonomy with community empowerment. These groups are formed by multiple Universal Business Interfaces (UBIs) and serve as platforms for group-based decision-making and the execution of large-scale projects within Avidica.

The primary duties of UBGs include formulating and proposing community initiatives, engaging in transparent and ethical governance, managing and allocating resources for community projects, collaborating with other UBGs and UBIs, participating in policy development, providing insights, ensuring compliance with Avidica's regulations and standards, and striving for continuous improvement in operations and governance.
